  On March 8th, Squirrel Hill Sports Bar will transform into a sanctuary for all things cathartic and angsty at Divorced Dad Rock Night. Doors open at 8:30 PM, and the night kicks off at 9:00 PM with a playlist straight out of the golden age of emotional rock anthems.
  Expect to feel “Fully Alive” as the music takes you back to the days when Nickelback’s choruses hit like a midlife crisis in a chorus of “Photograph.” Whether you’re “Here Without You” or wishing someone would “Bring Me to Life,” the night promises to stir your inner rock ballad soul.
