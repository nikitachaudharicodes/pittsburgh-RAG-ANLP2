Jan. 18–June 1

## [Winners of the 2024 Inclusive Call for Art](https://carnegiemuseums.org/envisioning-a-just-pittsburgh-2024/)

Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh, 1Hood Media, and the August Wilson African American Cultural Center again joined together to host the second iteration of Envisioning a Just Pittsburgh, an inclusive call for art that encouraged artists throughout southwestern Pennsylvania to share their visions for a just and equitable Pittsburgh. We are proud to announce the First and Second Place winners in the competition’s six categories.

[Through March 9](https://carnegiemnh.org/explore/stories-we-keep/)

## [More than 80 ancient Egyptian objects](https://carnegiemnh.org/explore/stories-we-keep/)

Every Egyptian object in the museum’s care has stories to tell, about its creation and original use, its journey to Pittsburgh, and about the lives of those in ancient Egypt. The Stories We Keep invites visitors to see these objects—cared for by the Museum for more than a century—in a new light and to witness the work that will preserve them for future generations.

The Sound Series also reaches into the community, utilizing venues such as Oakland’s Carnegie Music Hall and Carnegie Lecture Hall.
