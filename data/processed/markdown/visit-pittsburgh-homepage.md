# Pittsburgh Will Surprise You

Your new year begins in our city of multitudes

Spring and sunshine are making their way into the region, which means plenty of activities are starting to get outside. You can too with baseball season and different festivals and
[concerts](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/upcoming-concerts-in-pittsburgh/)
throughout the city, or you can wait out the last bits of cold with tons of indoor adventures still to be had.

[St. Patrick's Day](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/st-patricks-day-in-pittsburgh/)
is also right around the corner, so grab your favorite people and head out to at one of the largest St. Patrick's Day Parades in the United States.

For those ready to ditch their winter coats, we've got a lineup of spring scenes to fling yourself into. The Spring Flower Show kicks off at
[Phipps Conservatory](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/phipps-conservatory-and-botanical-gardens/)
, the
[Pirates](https://www.mlb.com/pirates)
host the Yankees in this year's home opener at
[PNC Park](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/pittsburgh-pirates-at-pnc-park/)
and
[Friday fish fries](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/fish-fry-days/)
will fill the area for a few weeks.

Need more ideas? Take a ride on the
[Inclines](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/how-to-ride-the-pittsburgh-inclines/)
and grab the
[perfect photo](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/holiday-photos-in-pittsburgh/)
as the snow falls. Or, just pick a new
[neighborhood](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/)
to explore!

Fill your itinerary by picking a new
[craft brewery](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/restaurants-culinary/craft-breweries/)
to try or refueling with
[dinner](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/restaurants-culinary/)
plans featuring iconic Pittsburgh eats such as the 2024 James Beard Award-nominated Apteka and Pusadee's Garden.

Rest up at fantastic
[accommodations](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/hotels-resorts/)
to recharge for the next day of exploring.
