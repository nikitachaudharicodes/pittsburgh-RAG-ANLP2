# In-Person Events

They are Carnegie Mellon’s most cherished traditions and part of the fabric that weaves the many generations of Tartans together. No matter your class year, these events are just so CMU.

[**Spring Carnival**](spring-carnival/index.html)
  

For more than 100 years, Spring Carnival has been one of the most anticipated weekends of the year. Tartans from around the world return to campus to carry on events like Booth, Buggy, MOBOT, Scotch’n’Soda performances and much more.

President Farnam Jahanian visits different cities throughout the year to meet Tartans across the country and share Carnegie Mellon’s inspiring vision for the future. Faculty members share cutting-edge research and alumni have a chance to network with each other and university leadership.
