The
**history of Pittsburgh**
began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern
[Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh")
region, known as
*Jaödeogë’*
in the
[Seneca language](/wiki/Seneca_language "Seneca language")
.
[[

]](#cite_note-Chafe2013-1)
Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the
[Allegheny](/wiki/Allegheny_River "Allegheny River")
and
[Monongahela Rivers](/wiki/Monongahela_River "Monongahela River")
meet to form the
[Ohio](/wiki/Ohio_River "Ohio River")
, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when
[France](/wiki/Kingdom_of_France "Kingdom of France")
and
[Great Britain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "Kingdom of Great Britain")
[fought for control in the 1750s](/wiki/French_and_Indian_War "French and Indian War")
. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi.

Following
[American independence](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War")
in 1783, the village around
[Fort Pitt](/wiki/Fort_Pitt_(Pennsylvania) "Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)")
continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived
[Whiskey Rebellion](/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion "Whiskey Rebellion")
, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The
[War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 "War of 1812")
cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the
[Allegheny Mountains](/wiki/Allegheny_Mountains "Allegheny Mountains")
. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877
[railway riots](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Railway_Riots "Pittsburgh Railway Riots")
it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the
[nationwide strikes](/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1877 "Great Railroad Strike of 1877")
of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel.

Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the
[Great Depression](/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States "Great Depression in the United States")
, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the
[New Deal Coalition](/wiki/New_Deal_Coalition "New Deal Coalition")
under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the "
[Arsenal of Democracy](/wiki/Arsenal_of_Democracy "Arsenal of Democracy")
", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.

Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the
[Pittsburgh metropolitan area](/wiki/Pittsburgh_metropolitan_area "Pittsburgh metropolitan area")
is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities.

## Native American era

Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years. These are some important villages, most c. 1750s, and earlier sites.

For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio.
[Paleo-Indians](/wiki/Paleo-Indian "Paleo-Indian")
conducted a
[hunter-gatherer](/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer")
lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago.
[Meadowcroft Rockshelter](/wiki/Meadowcroft_Rockshelter "Meadowcroft Rockshelter")
, an
[archaeological site](/wiki/Archaeological_site "Archaeological site")
west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.

During the
[Adena culture](/wiki/Adena_culture "Adena culture")
that followed,
[Mound Builders](/wiki/Mound_builder_(people) "Mound builder (people)")
erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of
[McKees Rocks](/wiki/McKees_Rocks,_Pennsylvania "McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania")
, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the
[Hopewell culture](/wiki/Hopewell_culture "Hopewell culture")
.
[[

By 1700 the
[Haudenosaunee](/wiki/Iroquois "Iroquois")
, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the
[Lenape](/wiki/Lenape "Lenape")
, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the
[Shawnee](/wiki/Shawnee "Shawnee")
, who had migrated up from the south.
[[

]](#cite_note-Sipe-4)
With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as
[smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox")
,
[measles](/wiki/Measles "Measles")
,
[influenza](/wiki/Influenza "Influenza")
, and
[malaria](/wiki/Malaria "Malaria")
, to which they had no immunity.

, a
[Lenape](/wiki/Lenape "Lenape")
(Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where
[Penn Avenue](/wiki/Penn_Avenue "Penn Avenue")
is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to
[George Croghan](/wiki/George_Croghan "George Croghan")
, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as
[Herr's Island](/wiki/Herrs_Island,_Pittsburgh "Herrs Island, Pittsburgh")

## Early colonization (1747–1763)

British and French Forts, 1753–1758, and the routes of the two British campaigns to take the forks of the Ohio


[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Forts_at_Forks_of_Ohio.png/280px-Forts_at_Forks_of_Ohio.png)](/wiki/File:Forts_at_Forks_of_Ohio.png)

The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.
[[
10
]](#cite_note-10)
Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first
[Ohio Company](/wiki/Ohio_Company "Ohio Company")
, a
[Virginian](/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia "Colony of Virginia")
land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km
2
) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day
[Cumberland, Maryland](/wiki/Cumberland,_Maryland "Cumberland, Maryland")
, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km)
[wagon road](/wiki/Wagon_train "Wagon train")
to the
[Monongahela River](/wiki/Monongahela_River "Monongahela River")
[[
11
]](#cite_note-Lorant-11)
employing a Lenape Indian chief named
[Nemacolin](/wiki/Nemacolin "Nemacolin")
and a party of settlers headed by Capt.
[Michael Cresap](/wiki/Michael_Cresap "Michael Cresap")
to begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail
[[
12
]](#cite_note-FortsCom-12)
now known as
[Nemacolin's Trail](/wiki/Nemacolin%27s_Trail "Nemacolin's Trail")
. The
[river crossing](/wiki/Ford_(river) "Ford (river)")
and flats at
[Redstone creek](/wiki/Redstone_Creek_(Pennsylvania) "Redstone Creek (Pennsylvania)")
, was the
[earliest point](/wiki/Redstone_Old_Fort "Redstone Old Fort")
and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified as
[Fort Burd](/wiki/Fort_Burd "Fort Burd")
(now
[Brownsville](/wiki/Brownsville,_Pennsylvania "Brownsville, Pennsylvania")
) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became
[Braddock's Road](/wiki/Braddock%27s_Road "Braddock's Road")
a few years later through present-day
[New Stanton](/wiki/New_Stanton,_Pennsylvania "New Stanton, Pennsylvania")
. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the
[Cumberland Narrows](/wiki/Cumberland_Narrows "Cumberland Narrows")
[pass](/wiki/Mountain_pass "Mountain pass")
before they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track.

The nearby Native American community of
[Logstown](/wiki/Logstown "Logstown")
was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley.
[[

Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by
[Celeron de Bienville](/wiki/Celeron_de_Bienville "Celeron de Bienville")
, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.
[[
12
]](#cite_note-FortsCom-12)
De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory.
[[
13
]](#cite_note-13)

In 1753,
[Marquis Duquesne](/wiki/Marquis_Duquesne "Marquis Duquesne")
, the
[Governor of New France](/wiki/Governor_of_New_France "Governor of New France")
, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day
[Erie, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Erie,_Pennsylvania "Erie, Pennsylvania")
, an advance party built
[Fort Presque Isle](/wiki/Fort_Presque_Isle "Fort Presque Isle")
. They also cut a road through the woods and built
[Fort Le Boeuf](/wiki/Fort_Le_Boeuf "Fort Le Boeuf")
on
[French Creek](/wiki/French_Creek_(Allegheny_River) "French Creek (Allegheny River)")
, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built
[Fort Machault](/wiki/Fort_Machault "Fort Machault")
at that site.
[[
14
]](#cite_note-Albert-14)

Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley,
[Governor Dinwiddie](/wiki/Governor_Dinwiddie "Governor Dinwiddie")
of Virginia sent Major
[George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington")
to warn the French to withdraw.
[[
15
]](#cite_note-ftpitt-15)
Accompanied by
[Christopher Gist](/wiki/Christopher_Gist "Christopher Gist")
, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Gwash_map01.jpg/290px-Gwash_map01.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gwash_map01.jpg)


[George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington")
's sketch of Monongahela River, Allegheny River (named as the upper Ohio), and French Creek that accompanied his journal (1753) in which he recorded his impressions:
[[
16
]](#cite_note-Washington-16)
> As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, & the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common Surface of the Water; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timber'd Land all around it, very convenient for Building.

Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddie's letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and then
[Fort Le Boeuf](/wiki/Fort_Le_Boeuf "Fort Le Boeuf")
. The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw.
[[
15
]](#cite_note-ftpitt-15)

Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain
[William Trent](/wiki/William_Trent "William Trent")
to build a
[fort](/wiki/Fort "Fort")
at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation
[[
17
]](#cite_note-17)
at the site of present-day
[Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh")
. The fort, named
[Fort Prince George](/wiki/Fort_Prince_George "Fort Prince George")
, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed
[Fort Duquesne](/wiki/Fort_Duquesne "Fort Duquesne")
.
[[
14
]](#cite_note-Albert-14)
[[
15
]](#cite_note-ftpitt-15)

Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in the
[Battle of Jumonville Glen](/wiki/Battle_of_Jumonville_Glen "Battle of Jumonville Glen")
, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner.
[[
18
]](#cite_note-18)
After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chief
[Tanaghrisson](/wiki/Tanaghrisson "Tanaghrisson")
, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign
[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville](/wiki/Joseph_Coulon_de_Jumonville "Joseph Coulon de Jumonville")
. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the
[Battle of Fort Necessity](/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Necessity "Battle of Fort Necessity")
. These frontier actions contributed to the start of the
[French and Indian War](/wiki/French_and_Indian_War "French and Indian War")
(1754–1763), or, the
[Seven Years' War](/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War "Seven Years' War")
, a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres.

In 1755, the
[Braddock Expedition](/wiki/Braddock_Expedition "Braddock Expedition")
was launched, accompanied by
[Virginia militia](/wiki/Virginia_militia "Virginia militia")
officer
[George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington")
. Two regiments marched from
[Fort Cumberland](/wiki/Fort_Cumberland_(Maryland) "Fort Cumberland (Maryland)")
across the

In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the "lower town", near the fort's ramparts, and the "upper town", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel
[Henry Bouquet](/wiki/Henry_Bouquet "Henry Bouquet")
and conducted by
[William Clapham](/wiki/William_Clapham "William Clapham")
counted 332 people and 104 houses.

After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of
[Pontiac's War](/wiki/Pontiac%27s_War "Pontiac's War")
. The
[Odawa](/wiki/Odawa "Odawa")
leader
[Pontiac](/wiki/Pontiac_(Ottawa_leader) "Pontiac (Ottawa leader)")
launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.
[[

Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the
[siege of Fort Pitt](/wiki/Siege_of_Fort_Pitt "Siege of Fort Pitt")
lasted for two months.
[[

European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were
[English-American](/wiki/English_Americans "English Americans")
, another third were

,
[German](/wiki/German_Americans "German Americans")
and others.
[[
23
]](#cite_note-Bartlett-23)
These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.
[[
23
]](#cite_note-Bartlett-23)
Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.

[Shawnee](/wiki/Shawnee "Shawnee")

tribes, led to
[Dunmore's War](/wiki/Dunmore%27s_War "Dunmore's War")
in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the
[Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War")
, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General
[Edward Hand](/wiki/Edward_Hand "Edward Hand")

With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784

Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the
[Whiskey Rebellion](/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion "Whiskey Rebellion")
in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at
[Braddock's Field](/wiki/Braddock%27s_Field "Braddock's Field")
and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.

Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods.
[Blacksmiths](/wiki/Blacksmiths "Blacksmiths")
forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.
[[

]](#cite_note-Lorant-11)

The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first
[steamboat](/wiki/Steamboat "Steamboat")
was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The
[War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 "War of 1812")
catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.
[[
11
]](#cite_note-Lorant-11)
In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.
[[
11

When, on March 18, 1816,
[Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh")

[coal dust](/wiki/Coal_dust "Coal dust")

Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from
[Baltimore](/wiki/Baltimore "Baltimore")
to
[Wheeling](/wiki/Wheeling,_West_Virginia "Wheeling, West Virginia")
, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the
["City of bridges"](/wiki/Bridges_of_Pittsburgh "Bridges of Pittsburgh")
over its two rivers.

On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of
[Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia")
. In 1834, the
[Pennsylvania Main Line Canal](/wiki/Pennsylvania_Main_Line_Canal "Pennsylvania Main Line Canal")
was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.

Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first
[locomotive](/wiki/Locomotive "Locomotive")
west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the
[Second Court House](/wiki/Allegheny_County_Courthouse "Allegheny County Courthouse")
, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high.

The iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s.

### Scots Irish leadership

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Scots Irish leadership")

]

Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was "largely Scotch Irish". Ingham finds that the
[Scotch Irish](/wiki/Scotch-Irish_American "Scotch-Irish American")
held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and "developed their own sense of uniqueness."
[[
36
]](#cite_note-36)

New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example,
[Thomas Mellon](/wiki/Thomas_Mellon "Thomas Mellon")
(b. Ulster 1813–1908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful
[Mellon family](/wiki/Mellon_family "Mellon family")
, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as
[James Laughlin](/wiki/James_Laughlin_(industrialist) "James Laughlin (industrialist)")
(b. Ulster 1806–1882) of
[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company](/wiki/Jones_and_Laughlin_Steel_Company "Jones and Laughlin Steel Company")
comprised the "Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society."

Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.

### Geography of industrialization

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Geography of industrialization")

]

Beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.
[[
43
]](#cite_note-43)

Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of
[Vandergrift](/wiki/Vandergrift,_Pennsylvania "Vandergrift, Pennsylvania")
, according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired
[Frederick Law Olmsted](/wiki/Frederick_Law_Olmsted "Frederick Law Olmsted")
's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as
[welfare capitalism](/wiki/Welfare_capitalism "Welfare capitalism")
, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the

]

During the
[Prohibition era](/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States "Prohibition in the United States")
, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.
[[
52
]](#cite_note-52)
[[
53
]](#cite_note-ended-53)
Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the
[Whiskey Rebellion](/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion "Whiskey Rebellion")
, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.
[[
53
]](#cite_note-ended-53)
The
[Pittsburgh crime family](/wiki/Pittsburgh_crime_family "Pittsburgh crime family")
controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.

During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.

### Environment

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Environment")

]

During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the
[Progressive Era](/wiki/Progressive_Era "Progressive Era")
and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.
[[

In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an
[explosion](/wiki/1927_Pittsburgh_gas_explosion "1927 Pittsburgh gas explosion")

To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the
[Shadyside](/wiki/Shadyside,_Pennsylvania "Shadyside, Pennsylvania")
and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown.
[Fifth Avenue](/wiki/Fifth_Avenue_(Pittsburgh) "Fifth Avenue (Pittsburgh)")
was dubbed "Millionaire's Row" because of the many mansions lining the street.

On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.

### New immigrants and migrants

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: New immigrants and migrants")

]

Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as
[South Side](/wiki/South_Side_(Pittsburgh) "South Side (Pittsburgh)")
,
[Polish Hill](/wiki/Polish_Hill "Polish Hill")
,
[Bloomfield](/wiki/Bloomfield_(Pittsburgh) "Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)")

### African Americans

[

]

Further information:
[Great Migration (African American)](/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American) "Great Migration (African American)")

The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the
[Great Migration](/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American) "Great Migration (African American)")
from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.
[[
63
]](#cite_note-63)
[[
64
]](#cite_note-64)
Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:

:   Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.
    [[
    65
    ]](#cite_note-65)

The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:

:   Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the
    *[Pittsburgh Courier](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Courier "Pittsburgh Courier")*
    ); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated.

The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the
[Hill District](/wiki/Hill_District "Hill District")
. It became an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as
[Duke Ellington](/wiki/Duke_Ellington "Duke Ellington")
and Pittsburgh natives
[Billy Strayhorn](/wiki/Billy_Strayhorn "Billy Strayhorn")
and
[Earl Hines](/wiki/Earl_Hines "Earl Hines")
played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the
[Pittsburgh Crawfords](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Crawfords "Pittsburgh Crawfords")
and the
[Homestead Grays](/wiki/Homestead_Grays "Homestead Grays")
, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the
[Negro National League](/wiki/Negro_National_League_(1933%E2%80%931948) "Negro National League (1933–1948)")
in the 1930s and 1940s.

### 1930s

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: 1930s")

]

Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,
[[
67
]](#cite_note-67)
and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the
[New Deal Coalition](/wiki/New_Deal_Coalition "New Deal Coalition")
. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the
[WPA](/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration "Works Progress Administration")
, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.
[[
68

]](#cite_note-69)

[Joseph Guffey](/wiki/Joseph_Guffey "Joseph Guffey")
, statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant
[David Lawrence](/wiki/David_L._Lawrence "David L. Lawrence")
gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the
[New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal "New Deal")
programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only "a challenge" but also "an opportunity". He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage.

Pittsburgh was at the center of the "
[Arsenal of Democracy](/wiki/Arsenal_of_Democracy "Arsenal of Democracy")
" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during
[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the
[Second Great Migration](/wiki/Second_Great_Migration_(African_American) "Second Great Migration (African American)")
from the South to the city in order to find work.

### Postwar

[David Lawrence](/wiki/David_L._Lawrence "David L. Lawrence")
, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.
[[
71
]](#cite_note-71)
Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.
[[
72
]](#cite_note-72)
In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.

in unforeseen ways.

"Renaissance I" began in 1946. Title One of the

provided the means in which to begin. By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower
[Hill District](/wiki/Hill_District "Hill District")
, an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using
[eminent domain](/wiki/Eminent_domain "Eminent domain")

, which opened in 1961.
[[

Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.

In the early 1960s, the neighborhood of
[East Liberty](/wiki/East_Liberty_(Pittsburgh) "East Liberty (Pittsburgh)")
was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51 km
2
) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district. In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979.

Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.

Like most major cities, Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the
[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.](/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.")
in April 1968. There were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini-mills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel.
[
*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*
]
Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the
[1973 oil crisis](/wiki/1973_oil_crisis "1973 oil crisis")
, and increasing use of other materials.
[[

### Collapse of steel

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Collapse of steel")

]

Further information:
[Steel crisis](/wiki/Steel_crisis "Steel crisis")

Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of
[United Steelworkers](/wiki/United_Steelworkers "United Steelworkers")
regarding wage cuts and
[work-rule](/wiki/Work-rule "Work-rule")
reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable "mini-mills" and non-union mills with lower labor costs.
[[
82
]](#cite_note-wolf-82)

Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the
[deindustrialization](/wiki/Deindustrialization "Deindustrialization")
of the U.S.
[[
84
]](#cite_note-84)
Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers.
[[
82
]](#cite_note-wolf-82)
The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed.
[[
85
]](#cite_note-85)
[[
86
]](#cite_note-86)
The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs.
[[
87
]](#cite_note-87)
Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the
[Rust Belt](/wiki/Rust_Belt "Rust Belt")
with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw
[white flight](/wiki/White_flight "White flight")
to the suburbs.
[[
88
]](#cite_note-88)

In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.

### Corporations

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Corporations")

]

Top corporate headquarters such as
[Gulf Oil](/wiki/Gulf_Oil "Gulf Oil")
(1985),
[Koppers](/wiki/Koppers "Koppers")
(1987),
[Westinghouse](/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_(1886) "Westinghouse Electric (1886)")
(1996) and
[Rockwell International](/wiki/Rockwell_International "Rockwell International")
(1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the "brain drain") as well as massive charitable contributions by the "home based" companies to local cultural and educational institutions. At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier. Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day.

Today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the
[Edgar Thomson Works](/wiki/Edgar_Thomson_Works "Edgar Thomson Works")
in nearby
[Braddock](/wiki/Braddock,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania "Braddock, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania")
.

### Higher education

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Higher education")

]

Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings,
[The University of Pittsburgh](/wiki/The_University_of_Pittsburgh "The University of Pittsburgh")
,
[Carnegie Mellon University](/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University "Carnegie Mellon University")
and
[Duquesne University](/wiki/Duquesne_University "Duquesne University")
.
[Carnegie Mellon University](/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University "Carnegie Mellon University")
and the
[University of Pittsburgh](/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh "University of Pittsburgh")
had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.
[[
89
]](#cite_note-89)
Other regional collegiate institutions include
[Robert Morris University](/wiki/Robert_Morris_University "Robert Morris University")
,
[Chatham University](/wiki/Chatham_University "Chatham University")
,
[Carlow University](/wiki/Carlow_University "Carlow University")
,
[Point Park University](/wiki/Point_Park_University "Point Park University")
,
[La Roche College](/wiki/La_Roche_College "La Roche College")
,
[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Theological_Seminary "Pittsburgh Theological Seminary")
, Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and the
[Community College of Allegheny County](/wiki/Community_College_of_Allegheny_County "Community College of Allegheny County")
.

Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the
[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center](/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh_Medical_Center "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center")
(26,000 employees) and the
[West Penn Allegheny Health System](/wiki/West_Penn_Allegheny_Health_System "West Penn Allegheny Health System")
(13,000 employees).

### Civic improvements

[
[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Civic improvements")

]

Despite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued. In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the
[Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation](/wiki/Pittsburgh_History_and_Landmarks_Foundation "Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation")
(Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies. Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the
[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad](/wiki/Pittsburgh_and_Lake_Erie_Railroad "Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad")
, a 1-mile (1.6 km) long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh. In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic
[adaptive reuse](/wiki/Adaptive_reuse "Adaptive reuse")
development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice. Aided by an initial generous gift from the
[Allegheny Foundation](/wiki/Allegheny_Foundation "Allegheny Foundation")
in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the
[Monongahela River](/wiki/Monongahela_River "Monongahela River")
, opposite the
[Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh)](/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Pittsburgh) "Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh)")
. Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to
[Forest City Enterprises](/wiki/Forest_City_Enterprises "Forest City Enterprises")
which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people – teachers, students, adults, and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.
[[
92
]](#cite_note-92)

During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for
[community development](/wiki/Community_development "Community development")
, through the work of activists such as
[Dorothy Mae Richardson](/wiki/Dorothy_Mae_Richardson "Dorothy Mae Richardson")
, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide
[NeighborWorks America](/wiki/NeighborWorks_America "NeighborWorks America")
. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.

In 1985, the
[J & L Steel](/wiki/J_%26_L_Steel "J & L Steel")
site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.
[[
27
]](#cite_note-WQED-27)
In the 1980s, the "Renaissance II" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as
[PPG Place](/wiki/PPG_Place "PPG Place")
. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared.
[[
27
]](#cite_note-WQED-27)
In 1992, the new terminal at
[Pittsburgh International Airport](/wiki/Pittsburgh_International_Airport "Pittsburgh International Airport")
opened.
[[
27
]](#cite_note-WQED-27)
In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by
[Heinz Field](/wiki/Heinz_Field "Heinz Field")
and
[PNC Park](/wiki/PNC_Park "PNC Park")
, despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League.
[[

Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.

### Pittsburgh today

[

Present-day Pittsburgh, with a
[diversified economy](/wiki/Economy_of_Pittsburgh "Economy of Pittsburgh")
, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for medicine and
[education](/wiki/Education_in_Pittsburgh "Education in Pittsburgh")
and
[culture](/wiki/Culture_of_Pittsburgh "Culture of Pittsburgh")
, has been ranked as one of the
[World's Most Livable Cities](/wiki/World%27s_Most_Livable_Cities "World's Most Livable Cities")
.
[[
95
]](#cite_note-rankings-95)
Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities. Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry.
[[
96
]](#cite_note-96)
Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook, and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh. As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies. The region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center. In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants, including from the Indian sub-continent. It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt.
