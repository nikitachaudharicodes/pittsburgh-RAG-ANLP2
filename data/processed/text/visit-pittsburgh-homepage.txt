Pittsburgh Will Surprise You
Your new year begins in our city of multitudes
Spring and sunshine are making their way into the region, which means plenty of activities are starting to get outside. You can too with baseball season and different festivals and
concerts
throughout the city, or you can wait out the last bits of cold with tons of indoor adventures still to be had.
St. Patrick's Day
is also right around the corner, so grab your favorite people and head out to at one of the largest St. Patrick's Day Parades in the United States.
For those ready to ditch their winter coats, we've got a lineup of spring scenes to fling yourself into. The Spring Flower Show kicks off at
Phipps Conservatory
, the
Pirates
host the Yankees in this year's home opener at
PNC Park
and
Friday fish fries
will fill the area for a few weeks.
Need more ideas? Take a ride on the
Inclines
and grab the
perfect photo
as the snow falls. Or, just pick a new
neighborhood
to explore!
Fill your itinerary by picking a new
craft brewery
to try or refueling with
dinner
plans featuring iconic Pittsburgh eats such as the 2024 James Beard Award-nominated Apteka and Pusadee's Garden.
Rest up at fantastic
accommodations
to recharge for the next day of exploring.
