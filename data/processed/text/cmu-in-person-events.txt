In-Person Events
They are Carnegie Mellon’s most cherished traditions and part of the fabric that weaves the many generations of Tartans together. No matter your class year, these events are just so CMU.

Spring Carnival
For more than 100 years, Spring Carnival has been one of the most anticipated weekends of the year. Tartans from around the world return to campus to carry on events like Booth, Buggy, MOBOT, Scotch’n’Soda performances and much more.
Homecoming Weekend
Each fall, the CMU community puts on their best Tartan for a weekend of family-friendly activities like the annual CMU Alumni Awards, campus tours, Buggy previews and the tailgate and football game.
Reunion Weekend
During Spring Carnival, Tartans celebrating their Reunion year join exclusive events, opportunities to connect — and reconnect — with peers and create new memories at CMU.
CMU Alumni Awards
Each year, Carnegie Mellon honors a group of exceptional alumni who have made an impact on their industries, their communities, their alma mater and lives around the world at this special event during Homecoming Weekend.
Presidential Tours
President Farnam Jahanian visits different cities throughout the year to meet Tartans across the country and share Carnegie Mellon’s inspiring vision for the future. Faculty members share cutting-edge research and alumni have a chance to network with each other and university leadership.
Tartans on the Rise
Every year, we celebrate the recent alumni who are making an impact in their organizations and in their communities, across the nation and around the world through leadership, innovation and career achievements.
